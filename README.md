# BackgroundData

This Wallpaper is just here for showing how easy any app can get all your information. It simultaneously checks your clock, your location, your available Wi-Fi Networks, open Bluetooth connections and your microphone. In the case of this Wallpaper, it doesnâ€™t send this data anywhere, but it makes you aware of what and how easy all this information is accessible.

The Source Code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/KJReal/BackgroundData)
